A Disaster Response Management System is designed to help authorities plan, coordinate, and manage relief efforts during natural or man-made disasters.
It tracks available resources like medical teams, shelters, and supplies in real time.
The system helps dispatch rescue teams quickly, communicate with affected populations, and record incident reports.
It includes features for early warning alerts, mapping disaster areas, and monitoring ongoing rescue operations.
By centralizing information, it improves decision-making and speeds up response times.
Ultimately, it helps save lives and reduces the impact of disasters on communities.
